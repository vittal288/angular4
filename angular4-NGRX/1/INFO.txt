WHAT IS NGRX (REDUX)
Lets use NGRX instead of services for state managment 
Earlier state managment is done with EventEmitter,Subject from RXJS


IS it no possible to handle async call in the NGRX, hence we are using still authService 
--> use ngRX, where state is distributed between many componensts 
--> dont use ngRX for maintaining the UI state in the HTML template like disabling the form or button 

@ngrx/effects:
--> This is component is used to deal with side effects of ngex/store, like to deal with async call operations or HTTP call 

@ngrx/router-store 
--> this component is used to manage the router state 

@ngx/store-devtools
--> to debug the state change of router's,applications's and UI's states in the applications
