Implement all these features : 
1.Check if a token is present at application startup (check the localStorage manually or use the Firebase SDK to do so - just make sure that you somehow wait for the SDK to finish its initialization)
2.Redirect the user if he want to access a protected route (right now, nothing happens) - inject the router and call this.router.navigate(...) to do so
3.Rdirect the user on logout so that he's not able to stay on pages which are reserved for authenticated users - you can simply inject the router and call this.router.navigate(...) in the logout() method
4. Inherit the HTTP class to send token in one shot for all services (like interceptor)
5.Notification of all transcantions to the user like "User success logs in, error messages or any"
6.Show the error to user for wrong password . or any error or validaiton error 
7. Implement loading button using angular ladda
